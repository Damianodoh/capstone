## Project Proposal

#### What is the problem you want to solve?

With any market good, consumers at some point, are in a state of considering whether or not to purchase the good. At this state they could be called considereres of the good, and if they purchase the good they have adopted this good. From this line of thinking, I want to understand which factors influence households who have **considered** roof top solar for their homes, to either **adopt** or not **adopt** the good. There are many reasons why consumers adopt, and choose not to rooftop adopt solar. For example, some adopt for financial gain while others adopt for environmental reasons. On the other hand, it is plausible that households who considered roof top solar choose not to adopt because the upfront cost is not financially viable. Understanding roof top solar adoption characteristics of consumers seems to be an extremely worth while endevour. Volatile energy prices, climate change, and lack of jobs in traditional energy sectors are all problems that could be alleviated with an increase in roof top solar adoption. 

#### Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?

I believe solar installation firms would be interested in this information as it would help them pinpoint marketing strategies to increase sales. Knowing which groups of consumers to target with advertising etc. could ultimately encourage consumers to adopt rooftop solar. I also believe governments and policy makers at all levels would find value in understanding the reasons why consumers adopt solar while others do not. It could be that many consumers have considered solar and would like to adopt but lack the financial resources to do so. This would allow policy makers to craft more effective incentive based policies and allow these households more resources to take up adoption. Last but not least, if climate change is as serious a threat as the majority of climate scientists claim it is, then society as a whole would benefit from an increase in rooftop solar adoption. 

#### What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?

I will be using a survey data set where all features are categorical, i.e no continuous variables. The name of the data set is "Understanding the Evolution of Customer Motivations and Adoption Barriers in Residential Solar Markets: Survey Data" and it has been made public by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). 

The data comprises of two surveys, an adopter survey and a considerer survey The adopter survey is limited to households who have adopted roof top solar and the consider survey is limited to households who have seriously considered adopting solar but have yet to do so. Obviously, at one point those that have adopted solar at one point where consideres of solar. The surveys where conducted in California, Arizona, New York, and New Jersey.

#### In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).

The analysis of categorical data must be approached in a different fashion than continuous data. Statistics such the mean and standard deviation cannot be computed and models such as linear regression are not useful. Luckily there are a range of statistical techniques and models that have been developed to analyze categorical and survey data. 

The data wrangling process will included importing the data into R and analyzing it for missing values, recoding assignments, and features useful for the analysis. The next step will be to plot and visualize the data to gain a more intuitive understanding of the relationships between the dependent variable and the independent variables. In addition to plotting/visualizing the data contingency tables will be created to tabulate and explore frequency distributions. Furthermore statistical tests such as the Pearson's chi squared test can be used to test the independence and dependence between groups and their responses to the survey questions. This will be helpful when choosing variables for the model.

The survey data has many explanatory variables that may be useful for explaining the variation in solar adoption. Solar adoption can be represented by a binary variable "HAVESOLAR" in the adopter and considerer survey data. If I append these two data sets the variable is equal to 1 for adopted solar, and equal to 0 if they have not adopted solar. I will use a logistic regression to determine which factors play a statistically significant role in solar adoption, where "HAVESOLAR" is the dependent variable. A full logistic regression analysis will be conducted such model diagnostics, confusion matrix, etc. 

If time permits I would like to perform a clustering algorithm on the data set. Because the data is categorical k-means clustering will not work. I have discovered a similar clustering algorithm that uses the mode as opposed to the mean called k-modes clustering. 

#### What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.

The deliverables will be a written report in rmarkdown in addition to slides for presentation or a blog posting on wordpress. Code will be available through github.
